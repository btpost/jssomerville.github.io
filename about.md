### Hello!

This is a project that I, Jesse Somerville, started on April 3rd, with intentions of posting about cyber security things that I find interesting. It has since evolved into a collaboration between several people that was long overdue.

This site now home to the content of myself, Brad Post, Kevin Snell, Maddie Stokes, and Makenzie Priest. We plan on having this content span across several topics including technology, math, pop culture, literature and film, and more.

The Title Hackney.cool stems from Hackney Street, the street that our two houses are currenly connected by. The .cool is just because we find it humorous and it was available.

If you have any questions or recommedations, click on the contact page above and leave us a message.

Thanks for visiting Hackney.cool
