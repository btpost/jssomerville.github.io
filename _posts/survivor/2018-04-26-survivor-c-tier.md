# Ranking the Seasons of Survivor
This is a list of every season of survivor with a short and mostly spoiler free summary and why/when you might want to watch it. This is intended as a guide for those who are new to Survivor or those who are unfamiliar with every season, which is likely for the general population considering there's over 500 episodes. This is also for super fans, like myself, who have seen every (or almost every) season and are curious as to how their opinions line up with my own.

## C Tier
### 25: San Juan del Sur (Season 29)
SJDS has everything you could want in a season of Survivor: a good winner, a fantastic tribal council, several gif-able moments, new and interesting challenges, and that's why this season made it to the C tier. It's at the bottom of the tier because it's just one of those seasons that kind of falls under the radar. Like I know this was a season, but I can't remember most things about it, and it's not at the top of my re-watch list. The best thing about this season is that it was the prerequisite for three fantastic players to come back for another season, one of whom is my favorite female to ever play.

**Watch When:** You're watching all the seasons and haven't seen this one or you want to see the castaways that come back for Cambodia. 
### 24: All Stars (Season 8)
The first season in Survivor when they bring back former castaways. The problem with this season is that the game hadn't changed enough yet and all the castaways played too predictably. But let's not forget that time a castaway got in a fight with a shark...and won. This season also has what is probably the most cringe-worthy moment in Survivor history, but it also has what has got to be the cutest.

**Watch When:** You're curious about the first returnee season and/or you want to see some legendary Survivor moments. 
### 23: Vanuatu (Season 9)
The second 'battle of the sexes' season, and not nearly as good as the first. The season starts out enjoyably, but starts to fall apart as it gets closer to day 39. That's because the casting is only average and when the castaways who I liked were eliminated, the game fell off for me. Also, when the game is going down the final stretch it becomes pretty obvious who the winner is going to be.

**Watch When:** You're trying to watch all the seasons and you haven't seen this one yet. 
### 22: Caramoan (Season 26)
If you've seen the fans vs. favorites seasons you'll understand why the narrative doesn't work, however, the first time it still managed to produce one of the best seasons the show has ever had, this season wasn't so lucky. Caramoan can be remembered for one of the hardest to watch moments in the show's history, for a winner who completely decimated the competition, and for a few favorites who produced even higher quality tv than their first time around. 

**Watch When:** You want to see a dominant winner and several great Survivor players. 
### 21: Game Changers (Season 34)
This season had so much potential, but it didn't live up to the expectations the producers must have had for it. The cast featured several players who deserved the title of *game changer* but even more who just didn't. I can't say much more without spoiling. The winner played a great game though. 

**Watch When:** You've seen some of the iconic Survivors and you want to see them again. 
### 20: Fiji (Season 13)
Fiji is really hard to rank. I have never been more enthralled by an episode of the show as I was during this season, but I have also never screamed more at my television while watching anything ever. That's because this season had the true Survivor GOAT and wow do they take you on a journey. This season also featured some good personalities, some beautiful scenery, some interesting twists, and resulted in a solid winner. 

**Watch When...** ever, you all need to see the GOAT.
### 19: Blood vs. Water (Season 27)
This season the producers went with an interesting twist, former tribe members paired with their loved ones. The twist did a little to prevent the usual fans vs. favorites pitfalls, but eventually fared the same fate. They also brought back redemption island, which worked better than it had in the past, but still wasn't the amazing idea that the producers probably wanted it to be when they thought of it. Regardless, good cast (for the most part, they did bring back one of, if not, my least favorite castaway ever), good winner, and an overall enjoyable season.  

**Watch When:** You're trying to watch all the seasons and you want to watch some good ones before you get to the point where you have to force yourself to sit through every episode. 
### 18: Guatemala (Season 11)
Guatemala was the first season where former castaways were brought back to lead tribes and I'm a big fan of the turnout for this particular season. This was also the first season where the hidden immunity idol was used, though it's hardly the same idol that we now know and love. The cast was very enjoyable, so much so that I'm shocked none of the first timers in this season have ever returned to play again. Sitting at the top of the C tier, this is my median season; everything above this is a good season, that's not to say all seasons below this are bad seasons though, that is not analogous. 

**Watch When:** You've seen Palau, you might want to have that context before you watch Guatemala.
