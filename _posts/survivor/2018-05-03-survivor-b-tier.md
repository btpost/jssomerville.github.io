# Ranking the Seasons of Survivor
This is a list of every season of survivor with a short and mostly spoiler free summary and why/when you might want to watch it. This is intended as a guide for those who are new to Survivor or those who are unfamiliar with every season, which is likely for the general population considering there's over 500 episodes. This is also for super fans, like myself, who have seen every (or almost every) season and are curious as to how their opinions line up with my own.
## B Tier 
### 17: Palau (Season 10) 
This is the hardest season to talk about without including spoilers. The narrative that makes this season unique can be seen from the first episode and on, but while it's neat and only ever happens in this season, it's also what makes me lose interest. What I can say is that the casting was above average and made for some great players and unforgettable moments. One unforgettable moment in particular. 

**Watch When:** You want to see a good season unlike any other. 
### 16: Samoa (Season 19)
This season might as well be called "Survivor: the *insert name of a castaway from this season* experience." No season has hinged more on one person's play than any other season. Another member of the cast actually got brought back with a loved one for later season and I loved her, but also had no idea who she was until I re-watched this season. So while that one person's play definitely took a lot out of Samoa, it still made it so fucking fun to watch. 

**Watch When:** You want to see one person completely dominate an entire season in a way nobody else has or ever will. 
### 15: Borneo (Season 1)
Here it is. My opinion on where the first season of Survivor stacks up as compared to all the seasons that followed. I've ranked all the seasons multiple times at this point and no season's number has varied more than Borneo. It was just such a different game that it's hard to compare to recent seasons. As for the actual content, there were several different theories on how to play the game, which is interesting to see. Unfortunately, the game play struggled due to one contestant realizing the best way to win much faster than all the others. 

**Watch When...** ever. It's the first season and if you're a true Survivor fan you should see it. 
### 14: The Australian Outback (Season 2) 
Eight of of the sixteen castaways from this season came back to play at least one other season. That speaks to how great the casting was, quite possibly the best of any season. As for the location... it had highs and lows. Watching castaways attempt to catch pigs was entertaining and definitely cannot be seen in most other seasons. However, watching castaways wither away from lack of proper nourishment for 42 days was harsh. It had to happen though, after all this was only season 2 and the execs needed to push people to their limits to see if they could... you know... survive. 

**Watch When:** You want to see what might be the best cast the show ever had in an environment that is unique in the show's history. 
### 13: Panama (Season 12)
Panama is the first season to feature Exile Island. Exile Island is a classic Survivor twist, second only to the hidden immunity idol, and this season deserves major props for being the first to include it and one of the best to utilize it. The casting is also great because of how the tribes started out and features two Survivor legends, both of whom come back for later seasons. 

**Watch When...** ever, a classic season every Survivor fan should see. 
### 12: Kaoh Rong (Season 32)
Kaoh Rong features one of my favorite narratives for the start of a season, Brain vs. Brawn vs. Beauty (P.S. Survivor execs you've done it twice and it's worked twice bring it back, k thanks). The reason this season works is because of the cast, I can't say anything more without remaining spoiler free, but *got damn* the cast is phenomenal. The only thing that went wrong with this season is that so many castaways end up leaving, two of whom had much more game left to be played. 

**Watch When...** ever you want.
