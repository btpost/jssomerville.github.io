# Ranking the Seasons of Survivor
This is a list of every season of survivor with a short and mostly spoiler free summary and why/when you might want to watch it. This is intended as a guide for those who are new to Survivor or those who are unfamiliar with every season, which is likely for the general population considering there's over 500 episodes. This is also for super fans, like myself, who have seen every (or almost every) season and are curious as to how their opinions line up with my own.
## A Tier
### 11: The Amazon (Season 6)
The first season to utilize the 'battle of the sexes' narrative and by far the most successful. Even though men vs. women had never been done before, the contestants never let it cloud their vision and the game play thrived because of it. As a true man's man I also must consider that I was absolutely captivated during a certain scene where certain beautiful women bathed each other, or during another certain scene where certain beautiful women decided to strip naked and jump in the water during a challenge for chocolate and peanut butter. 

**Watch When:** You want to see the success of a men vs. women season or you want to see naked bodies blurred out and act like it's the coolest thing ever. 
### 10: Philippines (Season 25)
Rounding out my top 10 is the season that ended the dark ages of Survivor. Three contestants who left earlier seasons due to injury returned, and all three came back to compete. A lot of the cast I can't remember honestly, but the members of the cast I can remember I loved. A strong winner, a strong villain, a good tribe vs. tribe story all combine to make Philippines an above average season. Honestly it deserves bonus points because if Survivor went on like seasons 21-24 Jeff Probst would have quit. 

**Watch When:** You want to see more of some of the castaways that played multiple seasons or you just want to see a good season. 
### 9: Tocantins (Season 18)
Four out of the sixteen castaways in this season came back. Generally when that many players in a season return, it was a good season. I'd even be happy to see three or four others return as well. I honestly think every single contestant in this season post merge deserved to be there, which I can't say about many other seasons. Not all of their strategies worked (because that would be impossible), but they all had a strategy! There were no 'goats' (I do not mean Greatest Of All Time when I use goat here - in Survivor context a 'goat' is someone who isn't strategizing throughout the game and has no chances of winning). Not to mention the location was new and the exile island twist played out in the best possible scenario. 

**Watch When:** You want to see a likable cast playing the game with several different schools of thought. 
### 8: Millennials vs. Gen X (Season 33) 
This season epitomizes the newest era of Survivor by expanding on the concept of 'voting blocks' first theorized in Cambodia and re-branding the idea as 'trust clusters.' This was due to the success of the narrative of the season because castaways were never blinded by the generation gap. Contestants saw the game only in terms of what moves they could make with what people to advance themselves in the game. There may not be another season where people flipped more from 'cluster' to 'cluster,' if you will. 

**Watch When:** You feel you have a good grasp of how people play the game of Survivor, because this season will flip that on its head. 
### 7: Pearl Islands (Season 7) 
*The* best first episode of any season in Survivor history. If you're not completely captivated in the first thirty minutes, well then, fuck you, you're wrong. Several castaways from this season return, rightly so. This season also has the epitome of nearly every castaway archetype: the strong leader, the provider, the villain, the strategist, and so on. This is the first season I can remember watching as a child and that's because it's just so good, even a seven year old knows it. 

**Watch When...** ever you want. Everybody who likes Survivor should see this season. 
### 6: China (Season 15)
China featured a very strong cast, several of whom came back for later seasons and were just as likable then as they were here. The location saw a nice blend of classic Survivor scenery mixed with new flora and fauna. The winner played a solid game start to finish, without blowing out the other contestants in the final tribal council, so that even in the last episode you have no idea who was going to come out on top. China is just great start to finish. There's one moment in the middle of the season that is annoying to watch, but it's my only qualm with the entire season, and even then the cast is smart enough not to let their bad decision drag on for more than one episode. This is also the last season you can see Jeff Probst in one of his illustrious cowboy hats...RIP. 

**Watch When...** ever you want. Honestly if this is the first season you watch, you're making a good choice.
