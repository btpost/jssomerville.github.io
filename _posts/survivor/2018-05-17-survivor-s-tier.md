# Ranking the Seasons of Survivor
This is a list of every season of survivor with a short and mostly spoiler free summary and why/when you might want to watch it. This is intended as a guide for those who are new to Survivor or those who are unfamiliar with every season, which is likely for the general population considering there's over 500 episodes. This is also for super fans, like myself, who have seen every (or almost every) season and are curious as to how their opinions line up with my own.

## S Tier
This is it. The S tier. The top 5. The best of the best. God I'm so excited to talk about these seasons. 
### 5: Cook Islands (Season 14)
I'm going to start with this season's gimmick - Survivor: Race Wars. I wish that was a joke. However, it meant the casting executives were being very specific with the contestants they picked to be on the show. Thus, Survivor legends were born. Re-watching this season for the first time in 10 years made me feel like a kid again: laughing out loud at the ridiculous situations the castaways got into, cheering with them as they left every ounce of their energy in the challenges, celebrating their triumphs and mourning in their defeats, just so much raw emotion. 

**Watch When...** ever. This was the last great season of the first era of Survivor. 
### 4: Micronesia (Season 16)
By now, you've heard me discuss the fans vs. favorites gimmick and how I feel it doesn't work. How then, is this season so great? Well, it's because the favorites were *that fucking good* and because some of the fans complemented them so well. This season's game play kicked off what I consider to be the second era in the history of Survivor, where contestants started playing mind games with a level of tenacity that others just weren't prepared for. Two moments from this season are considered some of the dumbest in Survivor history, and it's because they were being outplayed by legends who were just that much better than they were.

**Watch When:** You've watched a few seasons (preferably ones the favorites were on) and you're ready to see a whole new level of game play. 
### 3: Cagayan (Season 28)
This best season of first-time players in my opinion. Cagayan started out with what I thought was a questionable tribe divide: brain vs. brawn vs. beauty, but the result was incredible. The tribe stereotypes made every castaway feel like they had something to prove; not only did they have to prove why they deserved to be on the smart tribe for example, but they also had to show that there was more to them than the jock, the nerd, or the pretty face. This led to a series of unprecedented moves, some by individuals, others by entire tribes. It was Survivor on a level that had only ever been seen in veterans of the game. This season helped bring Survivor into it's third and current era - the era of voting blocks/trust clusters.  

**Watch When:** You've seen enough seasons to have a good grasp of the show, otherwise you won't appreciate it's majesty. 
### 2: Heroes vs. Villains (Season 20)
Heroes vs. Villains is everything you can hope for in an all returners season - the little puppers who are only there to fill numbers get sent home early and the big doggos are let loose to wreak havoc in every aspect of the game. Challenges - awe-inspiring, social interactions - charismatically conniving, strategy - ruthless and brilliant. This season epitomizes the second era in Survivor history, one filled with savage blind sides and cunning. Some of the biggest moves in the history of the game are in this season: unprecedented ideas that had never been (and maybe should have never been) conceived, moves where a player snuck into another's brain and mind fucked their conscious until they could only act as a mere puppet, tribal councils that will leave you shocked and amazed no matter how many times you see them. What a season. 

**Watch When:** You've seen enough of the show to appreciate the flawless social game and strategy some of these players employ. 
### 1: Cambodia (Season 31)
My favorite season of Survivor is made great because of its gimmick: Second Chance. Every player in this season played the game once before and did not win, a big twist from traditional all returnee seasons that hosted former winners. This ensured that all players were veterans of the game, while also keeping them all at the same level i.e. there were no easy targets. Another big part of the cast was that fans of the show voted them on, meaning that only people who showed potential in their first season got the chance to play. This also meant that everybody in this season was working their ass off constantly to prove to America that they deserved to be there, and it showed. Whether at camp, at a challenge, during a reward, the players in this season just never stopped playing. Plus, the twist the producers pulled with immunity idols was pure genius, it managed to both limit the number of idols in the game as well as ensuring that only the contestants who were willing to risk it all with a big move were the ones who got a chance to use an idol. This resulted in: my favorite challenge of all time, my favorite puzzle solving of all time, my favorite tribal council of all time, and other glorious moments in the shows history I'll never forget. 

**Watch When:** You've seen enough seasons to comprehend the phenomenon that is Survivor: Cambodia.
