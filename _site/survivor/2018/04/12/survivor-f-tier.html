            <h1 id="ranking-the-seasons-of-survivor">Ranking the Seasons of Survivor</h1>
<p>This is a list of every season of survivor with a short and mostly spoiler free summary and why/when you might want to watch it. This is intended as a guide for those who are new to Survivor or those who are unfamiliar with every season, which is likely for the general population considering there’s over 500 episodes. This is also for super fans, like myself, who have seen every (or almost every) season and are curious as to how their opinions line up with my own.</p>
<h2 id="f-tier">F Tier</h2>
<h3 id="35-one-world-season-24">35: One World (Season 24)</h3>
<p>One World is the third (technically maybe fourth) iteration of Survivor that begins with the men vs. women narrative, and there’s a reason the producers haven’t brought it back in the twelve seasons following. Without a doubt the worst pre merge ever; you’ll find yourself cringing time and time again and, if you’re like me, you may very well just stop watching the season all together before you make it to the merge. The one redeeming factor of this season is the <em>flawless</em> play of the winner, and is really the only reason why anybody should watch this season.</p>

<p><strong>Watch When:</strong> You want to see somebody dominate the rest of the cast.</p>
<h3 id="34-redemption-island-season-22">34: Redemption Island (Season 22)</h3>
<p>Redemption Island brought back two of the most iconic castaways in Survivor’s history. Unfortunately, these two players were just <em>too</em> iconic and the season failed because of it. It’s hard to say anything more than that while remaining spoiler free, but I will say that this season also had one of the best winners ever.</p>

<p>As for redemption Island, where strong players can fight for a chance to remain in the game, it wasn’t a terrible idea on paper (I think it actually succeeded in a later season), but it failed here just like everything else.</p>

<p><strong>Watch When:</strong> You want to see somebody dominate the rest of the cast and you’re intrigued as to what redemption island is.</p>
<h3 id="33-nicaragua-season-21">33: Nicaragua (Season 21)</h3>
<p>Nicaragua honestly did the best with what it had, it just didn’t have a lot. I want to say the young vs. old narrative was flawed from the start, but the producers brought it back for a later season and it was actually very successful. So what made this season so bad? The castaways just….weren’t interesting. It’s really as simple as that. Uninteresting people were put on the island and they did uninteresting things. It’s been a while since I watched this season and I can remember some of the characters and the final tribal council and everything, but I honestly can’t think of one moment where I was like “Wow, that was crazy! What a great move!”</p>

<p><strong>Watch When:</strong> You’ve watched all the other interesting seasons.</p>
<h3 id="32-south-pacific-season-23">32: South Pacific (Season 23)</h3>
<p>Rounding out the dark age of Survivor (Season 21-24), this season saw the return of one of my favorite castaways and one of my….least favorite? Idk, three seasons later and I’m still not sure how I feel about that guy. Anyway, this season brought back redemption island, and because of one castaway it once again failed to be an interesting twist. Plus, they voted out the eye candy <em>way</em> too early.</p>

<p><strong>Watch When:</strong> You really want to see one of the castaways they bring back, or you really want to see one of the castaways they brought back in a later season.</p>
<h3 id="31-thailand-season-5">31: Thailand (Season 5)</h3>
<p>Honestly, I haven’t finished this season. It can’t be as bad as the one’s I’ve listed though, right?</p>
